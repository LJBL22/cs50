Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The number of "N" cannot be too small; otherwise some teams did not even show up in the predication.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

My answer would be over 10000 simulations, because before this number, some teams did not even show up in the predication.
